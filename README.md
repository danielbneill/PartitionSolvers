# PartitionSolvers
Utilities for investigation of combinatorial optimization problems arising in common spatial scan statistics formulations, also related to notions of consecutive submodularity, convex optimization. See \bibitem{PN} Charles A. Pehlivanian, Daniel B. Neill, {\em Efficient Optimization of Partition Scan Statistics via the Consecutive Partitions Property}, preprint, 2021 

### Requirements:
- cmake
- swig
- google mock, test

SWIG bindings for best subset, best partition solvers, multiple flavors, multiple objectives
